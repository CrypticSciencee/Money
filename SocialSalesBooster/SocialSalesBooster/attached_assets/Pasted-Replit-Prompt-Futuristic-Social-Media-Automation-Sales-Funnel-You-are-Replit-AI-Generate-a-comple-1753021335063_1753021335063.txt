Replit Prompt: Futuristic Social‑Media‑Automation Sales Funnel

You are Replit AI. Generate a complete, production‑ready landing page (HTML, CSS, minimal JS) that sells my personalized AI automations for X (Twitter), Instagram, and YouTube to social‑media managers. The page must look futuristic and modern (think neon‑gradient accents, glassmorphism cards, smooth scroll animations) and function as a high‑converting sales funnel.

Technical Requirements

File structure: create index.html, styles.css, and script.js in the root.

Frameworks/Libraries: Use vanilla HTML5/CSS3/JS only (no React/Vue). Import Google Font "Poppins" and FontAwesome 6 for icons. Use AOS (Animate On Scroll) via CDN for reveal animations.

Responsive: Mobile‑first, flexbox/grid, breakpoints at 768 px & 1200 px.

Accessibility & SEO: semantic HTML (header, main, section, nav, footer), descriptive alt text, meta‑tags for title/description/opengraph.

Contact form: include a simple form that posts to Formspree (placeholder action). Validate required fields with JS.

Performance: inline critical CSS above‑the‑fold, lazy‑load images, compress hero background (placeholder hero-bg.webp).

CTA buttons: smooth‑scroll to contact form.

Visual Style Guide

Primary color: #1b1f3b (near‑black navy)

Accent gradient:  #00F5A0 → #00D9F5 (neon aqua)

Background: deep radial gradient + translucent glass panels (backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(180%))

Buttons: pill‑shape, glowing box‑shadow on hover.

Cards: rounded‑xl (18 px), subtle inner border (rgba 255,255,255,0.1).

Deliverable

Return the full contents of all three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) in your response so I can copy‑paste directly into Replit.

⚠️  Important: Optimize for clarity, persuasion, and conversion. Each section should naturally guide visitors toward booking a demo. Use concise, benefit‑oriented copy and strong verbs. Make headings front‑loaded with value. Keep paragraphs under 60 words. Use emojis sparingly (≤3 total) for emphasis only.
